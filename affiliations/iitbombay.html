                            <h2 class="iitb">What is Sense of Agency?</h2>
                            <p>As humans, we are used to feeling as though we are in charge of our actions. This
                                experience of being in control, called <a class="iitb">Sense of Agency</a>, is largely
                                influenced by the consequences observed due to carrying out a particular action. Sense
                                of Agency is central to the experience of being an autonomous and active agent in the
                                world. Understanding how the brain generates this Sense of Agency is a central question
                                in neuroscience, with implications for fields ranging from philosophy and psychology to
                                robotics and AI.</p>

                            <!-- <p>Several regions of the brain have been identified as contributors to the experience of agency. The pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), which is engaged in organizing and carrying out movements, is one of the important areas to note. When this region is disrupted, one may feel less in control of their actions as shown in previous TMS studies.</p> -->

                            <h2 class="iitb">Components and Measurement.</h2>
                            <p>Cognitive processes can access various signals produced by the brain that contribute to a
                                Sense of Agency at various moments. While sensory feedback signals are active after the
                                action has been completed, premotor signalling occurs before the action begins. These
                                two
                                components are called <a class="iitb">retrospective</a> and <a
                                    class="iitb">prospective</a> respectively.</p>

                            <p>Previous experiments have shown that Sense of Agency can be studied through <a
                                    class="iitb">Intentional Binding</a> - the subjective experience of the time which
                                has passed between an action and its consequent outcome. The experiment we used to study
                                Sense of Agency during this internship focuses on using Intentional Binding as a
                                subjective measure.

                            <p>A modified Libet's Clock method was used to collect the required data. The above paradigm
                                was conducted on 25 healthy adults who volunteered for the study (13 females, 12 males).
                                <a class="iitb">64-channel EEG data</a> was recorded in an acoustically and
                                electromagnetically attenuated room using Brain Vision actiCHamp Plus2. All
                                electrophysiological data was recorded at a 1000 Hz sampling rate.

                            <p style="margin-top: 1em;">The revolving alphabet clock was presented to the participants
                                on a monitor screen.
                                Participants were asked to perform a voluntary movement by pressing the spacebar key
                                anytime according to their wish after one complete rotation. 250 milliseconds later, a
                                tone
                                was played in accordance to a <a class="iitb">probability function</a>.</p>
                            <p>Approximately one rotation later, the clock disappeared and then was shown again with the
                                instructions to mark the position of the red dot at which they pressed the button. The
                                time difference between the percepted button press and actual button press is calculated
                                and saved as a measure of the <a class="iitb">judgement error</a>.</p>

                                existence of EEG signal markers which exist as differences between these two blocks.</p>
                            <p>The collected EEG data is analyzed subject-wise using the <a class="iitb">Welchâ€™s
                                    Method</a> for spectral density estimation. Based on these features extracted across

                                probability blocks. Along with the frequency domain features, two time domain features
                                are also computed for each EEG channel. To maintain information of the generic shape of

                            <p>Different standardization techniques, feature selection methods, and machine learning
                                models were tried and tested in this approach.</p>

                                    Feedback blocks</a>. Upon examining the intentional binding effects, it was also
                                observed that the judgement error is lower for the subjects in the 75 No Feedback block
                                than the 50 No Feedback block. This bolsters the idea that oneâ€™s own actions and
                                experiences are essentially related to predictions of outcomes rather than merely
                                judgements drawn in hindsight after the fact.</p>
