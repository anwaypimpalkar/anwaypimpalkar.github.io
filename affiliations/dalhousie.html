                            <h2 class="dal">Wild Blueberries!</h2>
                            <p>Wild blueberries, also known as Vaccinium angustifolium, grow low to the ground in rocky
                                areas, offering a bold, untamed flavor that distinguishes them from their cultivated
                                counterparts. These berries are not only packed with antioxidants and nutrients, making
                                them
                                a powerhouse of goodness, but also hold a unique place in North America's natural
                                history,
                                being one of the three berries native to the continent.</p>

                            <p class="dal" style="margin-bottom: 0em; font-weight: bold;">A Natural Growth Process</p>
                            <p>Unlike cultivated blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum), which
                                require careful planning and
                                planting, wild blueberries grow naturally in fields and rocky hills called barrens. They
                                have thrived without human intervention for thousands of years, making them a
                                low-maintenance crop. Field owners usually take a hands-off approach throughout most of
                                the
                                growing season, only introducing bees to naturally pollinate the bushes. With a two-year
                                crop cycle, these fields are pruned every other year using rotary mowers.</p>

                                style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em;">

                            <p class="dal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2em; font-weight: bold;">Distinctive Characteristics
                            </p>
                            <p>Wild blueberries are much smaller than their cultivated relatives and vary in color from
                                different shades of blue to almost black. Their taste ranges from very sweet to
                                not-so-sweet, reflecting their genetic diversity. In contrast, cultivated blueberries
                                are uniform in size, color, and taste due to selective breeding and farming practices.
                                This genetic diversity, untouched by human intervention, makes wild blueberries a highly
                                diverse crop compared to the uniformity of cultivated varieties.</p>

                            <p class="dal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2em; font-weight: bold;">Growth and Harvesting
                            <p>Wild blueberry bushes, known as "lowbush," spread low and wide through runners, covering
                                fields in a random manner. In contrast, "highbush" cultivated blueberries stand in
                                straight
                                rows and tower over the average person. Due to their low height and the often rocky
                                terrain
                                where they grow, many wild blueberry fields cannot be harvested with traditional
                                machinery.
                                Instead, they are often hand-harvested using rakes.</p>

                            <h2 class="dal">Mechanical Harvesting Methods</h2>
                            <p>Harvesting wild blueberries by hand is a tiring and laborious task. To ease this process,
                                advances have been made to use mechanical tractor-based harvesters. Using large
                                harvesters for such small berries requires meticulous adjustments to the harvester
                                head's height, speed, angle, and various other controls to ensure optimal performance.
                                This careful calibration ensures that the berries are not crushed, missed during
                                harvesting, or contaminated with soil. After meticulous monitoring, the berries are
                                harvested and collected into large yellow bins at the back of the tractor, then shipped
                                off for processing and sale.</p>
                            </p>

                            <p class="dal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2em; font-weight: bold;">Problems with Mechanization
                            </p>
                            <p>The driver plays a crucial role, overseeing the all minor adjustments of the harvester
                                head, monitoring the berries harvested, and determining when bins are full, and
                                replacing them as needed. All of this is besides driving the tractor in the first place!
                                The multitude of controls can get overwhelming for the operator very quickly. To address
                                this challenge, our goal was to introduce automation to some of these tasks. <a
                                    class="dal" style="font-weight: bold;">We aimed to
                                    automate the measurement of berry volume in the bins and the automatic switching of
                                    bins
                                    once they are full.</a> This advancement is the first step towards alleviating the
                                burden on the driver while also enhancing the efficiency and precision of the harvesting
                                process.

                            <p>To accurately measure the volume of berries in the bins, we implemented a camera-based
                                system. A Time-of-Flight and RGB camera are mounted on the harvester, facing downwards
                                towards the bin. This setup utilizes image segmentation and point cloud processing
                                algorithms to estimate the volume of the berries effectively. The system is designed to
                                be robust, ensuring
                                reliable performance in various lighting conditions, including harsh sunlight. It also
                                adapts to different bin depths and colors. This significantly enhances the efficiency of
                                the harvesting process by providing precise volume measurements and reducing the manual
                                workload for the operator. Details of these
                                algorithms can be provided upon request.</p>
